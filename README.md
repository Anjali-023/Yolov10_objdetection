**Project Overview**

Welcome to the Nuts and Bolts Detection project! This repository contains a machine learning model developed to detect and classify nuts and bolts in images using the YOLOv10 (You Only 
Look Once) algorithm. YOLOv10 is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy, making it an excellent choice for real-time applications.

  ## Features

- **Real-time detection**: The model can detect and classify nuts and bolts in real-time.
- **High accuracy**: Achieved through the use of YOLOv10.
- **Scalability**: Can be trained on custom datasets for various industrial applications.
- **Easy integration**: Can be easily integrated into existing systems.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/nuts-and-bolts-detection.git
    cd nuts-and-bolts-detection
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Detecting Nuts and Bolts

1. **Prepare your input images**: Place the images you want to analyze in the `input_images` directory.

2. **Run the detection script**:
    ```bash
    python detect.py --input input_images --output output_images
    ```
   The detected objects will be saved in the `output_images` directory with bounding boxes drawn around them.

### Customizing Detection Parameters

You can customize various detection parameters (e.g., confidence threshold, IOU threshold) by modifying the `config.yaml` file.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing includes labeled images of nuts and bolts. You can download the dataset from [this link](dataset-link) or use your own dataset by following the same structure.

### Dataset Structure

```
dataset/
├── images/
│   ├── train/
│   ├── val/
│   └── test/
└── labels/
    ├── train/
    ├── val/
    └── test/
```

## Training

To train the model on your dataset:

1. **Prepare the dataset**: Ensure your dataset is structured as described above.

2. **Run the training script**:
    ```bash
    python train.py --config config.yaml
    ```

The training process will save model checkpoints and logs in the `checkpoints` directory.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the model's performance on the validation or test set:

```bash
python evaluate.py --config config.yaml --dataset val  # or 'test'
```

Evaluation metrics (e.g., mAP, precision, recall) will be displayed and saved in the `results` directory.

## Results

Sample detection results are shown below:

- **mAP**: 0.95
- **Precision**: 0.96
- **Recall**: 0.94
